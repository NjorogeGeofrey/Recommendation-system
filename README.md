# Recommendation System
In this project we shall build a user based movie recommendation system.
The concepts used are:
- Eucledian Distance
- Pearson Correlation
We shall build a function that allows us to make movie recommendations to any of the user we have in the database using either pearson correlation or Euclidian similarity scores
We shall also be able to see which users are more similar to one another.
Check the notebook for more details I have included the comments explaining everything.
Feel free to make any contributions.
